# Fruity Fox ü¶ä Skin for Firefox  
*Inspired by Arc and Zen ‚Äî A clean, modern, minimalistic UI skin for Firefox*

---

## Introduction

Welcome to **Fruity Fox ü¶ä**, a sleek Firefox skin inspired by the popular Arc and Zen themes known for their minimalist and elegant user interfaces. This theme focuses on clean lines, subtle color accents, and a distraction-free browsing experience. Whether you're a macOS or Windows user, Fruity Fox enhances your Firefox interface with a modern and fresh look that adapts to your system‚Äôs light or dark mode preferences.

- **Using colors and effects** inspired by Arc and Zen for a calming and consistent appearance  
- **Supporting modern Firefox features** like Mica blur on Windows for a sleek translucent background  
- **Automatically adapting** to your OS‚Äôs color scheme (light/dark)
